                A letter to her,

            <h3>
                We always meet the best love in the age when we don't know the most. Some people passes through your life, you must know how to cherish and thank them for appearing, and she is one of them, sadly, I could not get her to stay.
            </h3> 
        
            <h4>
                Time flies so fast, like a blink of an eye, I wonder how she have been. I miss the study life of high school. When senior high started , I unintentionally noticed her, partly because her voice is so loud most of the time. I really didn't know what I liked at that time, I'm just some average student trying to pass. I really didn't know how it happened. I only hinted about how I feel to her and never told her directly. Things just stayed like that until I finished highschool. Felt really down the time she started ignoring me. Hated that feeling until sometime I realized how funny it is to feel down of such irrelevant things like these. Never again.
